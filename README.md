# Crisis-Response-Strategy
# Overview
The "Crisis Response Strategy" document is an academic report focused on the interaction between fiscal and monetary policies in addressing economic crises driven by demand deficiencies. The report uses the IS-LM (Investment-Savings and Liquidity preference-Money supply) framework to analyze how these policies can be coordinated to mitigate the adverse effects on investment and money demand during an economic downturn.

# Contents
Problem Statement: Introduces the scenario of an economic crisis characterized by demand deficiency and the need for expansionary fiscal policy. It outlines the challenge faced by policymakers in balancing fiscal stimulus with the potential negative impacts on investment and interest rates.

Introduction: Provides a brief overview of the economic situation under consideration and introduces the IS-LM model as the analytical framework for the report.

Expansionary Fiscal Policy: Discusses the need for government intervention through increased spending or tax cuts to boost aggregate demand. It explains how these measures shift the IS curve to the right, countering the effects of demand deficiency.

Role of Monetary Policy: Explores how monetary policy can support fiscal expansion by increasing the money supply to lower interest rates, thereby encouraging investment and consumption. The section emphasizes the importance of coordination between fiscal and monetary policies to ensure effective economic recovery.

Conclusion: Summarizes the findings and stresses the importance of synchronizing fiscal and monetary policies to stabilize the economy during downturns.
